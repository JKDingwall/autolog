CHANGES(autolog):
================
- 0.2:
	Added 'hard' logout feature.  Several bug fixes.

- 0.21:
	Added 'pre-clear' option.

- 0.30:
	Rewrote the configuration file parser. Added group matching
	and the "nowarn" option. Rewrote/cleaned up almost the whole
	program.

- 0.31:
	Fixed bug with searching for group. If the group could not
	be found from the username, the program would segmentation
	fault.  Hopefully fixed.

- 0.32:
	re_exec seems to have a bug that dumps core in some cases.
	I rewrote the pat_match routine to not use it. Both versions
	of pat_match are included with an #ifdef.

- 0.33: Nov 1996        Kyle Bateman <kyle@actarg.com>
	
	Fixed bug in logging routine.  When writing to log file,
	the program could crash.  Also more careful check for
	non-existent processes.

- 0.34:	Dec 1996        Kyle Bateman <kyle@actarg.com>
	
	Added man pages (thanks to Christoph Lameter).
	Some login processes didn't twiddle the "last access"
	time when a user first logged in.  Checked to see if
	last access was older than login time to rule out
	such problems.

- 0.35:	Oct 1998        Kyle Bateman <kyle@actarg.com>
	
	fixed segfault error (Thanks to Thomas Gray).
	fclose(log) was being called even when the logfile
	hadn't been opened.

- 0.40: April 2000     Carsten Juerges <juerges@cip-bau.uni-hannover.de>
	
	Rewritten parts of the code to chase users and to make sure,
	they get the information about their approaching end.
	
	April 14, 2000
	
	Detected some old(?) ps-commands which do not support the
	parameters, I used. rewritten this part and enabled a
	feature to pass any strange ps-command via config-file.
	
	April 28, 2000
	
	Checked README-file and the manual-entries to make sure
	one will find information about all the new features.
	Added a little feature "nolostkill" to stop this program
	from killing lost processes.
	
	Only lost processes with uid (user-id) between 500 and 60000
	will be killed, others usually belong to system processes.

- 0.41: May 2020       James Dingwall <james.dingwall@ncrvoyix.com>

	Merge patches carried by debian which are not related to
	packaging:
	- 01_Makefile.patch
	- 02_autolog.patch
	- 04_check_ps_output.patch
	- 05_Fix-spelling-errors.patch
	- 06_adjust_makefile.patch
	- 07_clang-ftbfs.patch
	- 08_trailing_whitespace.patch

	Reformat the autolog.c source to for a more consistent style:
	- consistent tabbed indent instead of whitespace mix
	- insert spaces around operators for better readability
	- consistent brace usage for if/then/else etc

	Squash some warnings reported by gcc
	  (gcc (Ubuntu 7.5.0-3ubuntu1~18.04) 7.5.0)

	User id range checking adjusted to suit debian and systems where valid
	user accounts may have a uid >60000.

	Improvements in string length handling:
	- Use utmp #defines UT_NAMESIZE and UT_LINESIZE for string lengths
	  in userdata struct
	- Use 'n' versions of strcpy / strcmp / sprintf
	- Use a default ps command which prints usernames to 32 chars
